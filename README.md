# SpaceBoot
An unobtrusive, dependable utility and antivirus bootblock with compatibility and enhancement features for all Amigas, including maximizing chip memory ("Add44K") for file-based software distribution (as opposed to track-loaded or HDD install archives) as well as for creating programs, graphics, music, etc. using native applications.

Extensively tested, so that changes are not expected. But bug reports and change requests (cosmetics to entire function replacements, within reason and space available) are heartily welcomed via GitHub's issue tracker! They will be implemented ASAP, so that again changes are not expected and the tool can be relied on for distribution for all.

SpaceBoot is the first of a package of small utilities with the purpose of freeing Amiga developers to write programs distributed on bootable media without having to depend on AmigaOS include file packages and commands that distributed aside Kickstart images.
